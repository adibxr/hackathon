## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated orange (#FF7700) to evoke the 'fire bolt' logo and convey energy and intensity. The design uses a light theme.
- Background color: Very light orange (#FFF2E6), creating a subtle, desaturated backdrop that aligns with the primary hue and complements the light theme.
- Accent color: Yellow-orange (#FFA500), slightly different in brightness and saturation from the primary color to highlight interactive elements and calls to action.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif), lending a tech-forward, modern aesthetic ideal for headings.
- Body font: 'Inter' (sans-serif), chosen for its modern, neutral, and readable qualities, making it well-suited for body text.
- Use the 'fire bolt' logo as a core design element, integrating it into icons and other visual elements. The icons used can be geometric and related to cyber security, creating a unified and thematic design.
- Implement a 'glassy blur' effect (frosted glass) for the header and main sections, creating a semi-transparent, layered look. This approach provides a modern and visually appealing interface.
- Introduce subtle animations for UI elements like hover effects on buttons and smooth transitions between sections, to add a modern and interactive feel.
